Trend Analysis:

### How have the stock prices of the top 5 S&P 500 companies trended over the past years?
Nvidia emerges as the standout performer in stock growth over the analyzed period, notably surpassing its peers, especially post-2021. However, it faced a setback in 2022 due to US export restrictions on its AI chips for China and Russia, leading to a significant drop in stock value. Microsoft's stock showed steadier growth, while Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet exhibited relatively similar trajectories, indicating less volatility. The overall market downturn in 2022, triggered by the Ukraine-Russia conflict, affected global economies, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest drop since 2020. Nvidia's success story in 2023, fueled by growing demand for AI-related chips, positions it as a top performer. Apple's revenue history reflects its market evolution, with the iPhone remaining a key revenue driver despite fluctuations.
