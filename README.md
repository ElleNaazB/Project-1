## Introduction
In this project, titled "Exploratory Data Analysis of the Top 5 S&P 500 Companies," our team, comprising Elle Behnia, Pawanpreet Dhillon, Naqibullah Falak, Nafisa Khan, and Santosh Poudel, sets out to investigate the stock performance of the leading giants in the S&P 500 index. Specifically, our focus narrows to Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA), and Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL). Through a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, we aim to unravel the dynamics of their stock prices, assess the returns on investment, volatility, and price stability, and compare their performance against one another. Furthermore, we seek to identify correlations in their performance and delineate observable short-term and long-term trends in their trading data. This analysis is designed to provide valuable insights and conclusions to potential investors regarding the performance of these top-tier companies. Utilizing datasets from reputable sources like NASDAQ or Google database, our methodology encompasses data collection and cleaning, exploratory and statistical analysis, comparative and correlation analysis, and trend examination, culminating in a detailed report of our findings.
