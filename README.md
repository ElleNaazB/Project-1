# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Top 5 S&P 500 Companies' Volatility 

 <a href= "https://github.com/ElleNaazB/Project1/blob/Elle/StockVolatility.ipynb">The script </a> in this branch calculates and analyzes the following questions for potential investors to consider :

 # How volatile are the stock prices of the top 5 S&P 500 companies?

<p> To answer this question the risk associated with the price movements were quantified by using python code to calculate the following: 
  
    + Mean, Median, Standard Deviation 
    + Daily Volatility 
    + Annual Volatility 
    + Normalized Stock Closing Prices
    + Stock Price Trends 
    + 30-day Rolling Volatility 
  
The findings were subsequently illustrated through a bar chart and a line graph to facilitate clearer evaluation.</p>


<p> The result indicated that Nvidia (NVDA) has the highest volatility among the five stocks. Its stock price has been the most prone to large swings. This suggests that Nvidia's stock has been the most unpredictable and may be considered the riskiest investment of the five .</p>



# How do the companies compare to each other in terms of stock performance and volatility?
<p> To snswer the question above the following were calculated : 
  
    + Beta (Î²)
    + 95% VaR using the Historical Method

Overall. the findings show that NVDA is the most volatile with the highest potential loss in a day at the 95% confidence level, while SPY (which mimics the performance of the S&P 500) is the least, reflecting the reduced risk associated with a diversified portfolio. AMZN carries more risk than AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT, but less than NVDA. These VaR figures are critical for investors in assessing and comparing the risk profile of different stocks and making informed decisions aligned with their risk tolerance.
