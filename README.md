# Project 1 -Cumulative Return Analysis

**What is total return/cumulative return?**
The total return produced by an investment over a specified period is known as the cumulative return. 

**What is annualized return for an investment?**
The money gain in the first year is called annualized return of an investment. The money that gain for the end of second year (period), is defined cumulative return. 

**Opens price:**
the price when the market opened in the morning. 

**Close price:**
The price when the market close at the end of trading day. Or closing price simply refers to the cost of shares at the end of the day.

**High price:**
the highest price trading during that day. 

**Low price**: 
the lowest price during that trading day. 

**Volume:**
Volume analysis refers to the examination of the total number of securities transacted within a given time period. Trading volume can be analyzed to infer many trends in financial markets, such as liquidity, price reversal, trend confirmation, bullish signs, etc.
Volume measures the number of shares traded in a stock or contracts traded in futures or options. Volume can indicate market strength, as rising markets on increasing volume are typically viewed as strong and healthy. When prices fall on increasing volume, the trend is gathering strength to the downside.

**Adjusted close price:**
the adjusted closing price takes dividends, stock splits, and new stock offerings into account. The adjusted closing price is a more accurate indicator of stock value since it starts where the closing price finishes. the adjusted closing price takes dividends, stock splits, and new stock offerings into account.

**Daily percentage change:**

r_t=p_t/p_(t-1) -1
as an example the daily return percentage of the amazon based on the data analysis at python is:

**Cumulative return formula**:
i_t=(1+r_t ) i_(t-1)=(1+p_t/p_(t-1) -1) i_(t-1)=p_t/p_(t-1)  i_(t-1)
〖⟹i〗_t=  p_t/p_(t-1)  i_(t-1)
i_t= cumulative return for the specific period
p_t= present price 
p_(t-1)= pervious price 

**What is reason behind high cumulative return for NVDA company then, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, and MSFT. **

# Many reason is behind Nvidia return investment:
- Nvidias singles GPU AI training speed performance has increased by a dramatic in the 10 latest year. As using the AI tools get increased at the latest year, every top companies have been use that tools to their daily performance.

- Simplifications in number representation for the weights of neural network, more complex mathematical instructions for reducing the computational overhead involved in mathematical calculation.

- Increase neuron sparsity in neural networks.

- Nvidia also made improvements in data center scale architecture that allows groups of GPUs to work more efficiently together.

- The chipmaker traditionally known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have powered industries like gaming, crypto, and autonomous vehicles, has emerged as the clear leader in artificial intelligence (AI) chips as its technology is also well suited to running the kind of deep learning models that programs like ChatGPT require.
